	<description>Giddy-up! Let colonists Ride to their destination and Roll there. 
Banastra: "Hey Stein, can you go mine some steel? We're running out."
Stein: "But the only deposit is on the other side of the map! Why don't you do it?"
Banastra: "Well, I'm incapable of mining, you know that. Why don't you just take an animal and Ride and Roll?"
Stein: That's a thing now? 

Yes it is. With Giddy-up! Ride and Roll, you'll save your colonists the pain of walking everywhere, as it allows them to use mounts whenever it makes sense.
When a colonist wants to go to a destination, he will walk to an animal, mount it, and ride to the destination, given that it would take him there faster (this all happens automatically). 
Depending on the job the pawn wants to do on the destination, the pawn will either dismount before doing the job, or stay mounted.
